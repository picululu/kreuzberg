# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **MDX format support** (`mdx` feature): Extract text from `.mdx` files, stripping JSX/import/export syntax while preserving markdown content, frontmatter, tables, and code fences
- **List supported formats API** (#404): Query all supported file extensions and MIME types via `list_supported_formats()` in Rust, `GET /formats` REST endpoint, `list_formats` MCP tool, or `kreuzberg formats` CLI subcommand

---

## [4.3.7]

### Added

- NFC unicode normalization applied to all extraction outputs, ensuring consistent representation of composed characters across all backends (gated behind `quality` feature)
- Configurable PDF page margin fractions (`top_margin_fraction`, `bottom_margin_fraction`) in `PdfConfig`
- PDF annotation extraction with new `PdfAnnotation` type supporting `Text`, `Highlight`, `Link`, `Stamp`, `Underline`, `StrikeOut`, and `Other` annotation types
- `extract_annotations` configuration option in `PdfConfig`
- `annotations` field on `ExtractionResult` across all language bindings (Rust, Python, TypeScript, Ruby, PHP, Go, Java, C#, Elixir, WASM)

### Fixed

- **PDF markdown extraction quality at parity with docling** (91.0% avg F1 vs docling's 91.4% across 16 test PDFs, while being 10-50x faster): Replaced `PdfiumParagraph::from_objects()` with per-character text extraction using pdfium's `PdfPageText::chars()` API, which correctly handles font matrices, CMap lookups, and text positioning. Adaptive line-break detection uses measured Y-position changes rather than font-size-relative thresholds, fixing PDFs where pdfium reports incorrect unscaled font sizes.
- **PDF markdown extraction no longer drops all content on PDFs with broken font metrics**: Added font-size filter fallback — when the `MIN_FONT_SIZE` filter (4pt) removes all text segments (e.g. PDFs where pdfium reports `font_size=1` due to font matrix scaling), the filter is skipped and unfiltered segments are used instead.
- **PDF margin filter no longer drops all content on edge-case PDFs**: Added margin filter fallback — when margin filtering removes all text segments (e.g. PDFs where pdfium reports baseline_y values outside expected margin bands), the filter is skipped for that page.
- **PDF ligature repair integrated into per-character extraction**: Ligature corruption (`fi`→`!`, `fl`→`#`, `ff`→`"`) is now repaired inline during character iteration rather than as a separate post-processing pass, improving both accuracy and performance.
- **PDF multi-column text extraction** improved: Federal Register-style multi-column PDFs went from 69.9% to 90.7% F1 by using pdfium's text API which naturally handles reading order.
- PDF table detection now requires ≥3 aligned columns, eliminating false positives from two-column text layouts (academic papers, newsletters)
- PDF table post-processing rejects tables with ≤2 columns, >50% long cells, or average cell length >50 chars
- PDF markdown rendering no longer drops content when pdfium returns zero-value baseline coordinates (fixes missing titles/authors in some LaTeX-generated PDFs)
- PaddleOCR backend validation now dynamically checks the plugin registry instead of hardcoding, preventing false "backend not registered" errors when the plugin is available (#403)
- WASM bindings now export `detectMimeFromBytes` and `getExtensionsForMime` MIME utility functions
- Node.js NAPI-RS binding correctly exposes `annotations` field on `ExtractionResult`
- Python output format validation tests updated to reflect `json` as a valid format (alias for `structured`)
- XLSX extraction with `output_format="markdown"` now produces markdown tables instead of plain text (#405)
- MCP tools with no parameters (`cache_stats`, `cache_clear`) now emit valid `inputSchema` with `{"type": "object", "properties": {}}` instead of `{"const": null}`, fixing Claude Code and other MCP clients that validate schema type (#406)
- Python `get_valid_ocr_backends()` now unconditionally includes `paddleocr` in the returned list, matching all other language bindings
- TypeScript E2E test generator now maps `extract_annotations` to `extractAnnotations` in `mapPdfConfig()`, fixing annotation assertion failures
- PHP `PdfConfig` now includes `extractAnnotations`, `topMarginFraction`, and `bottomMarginFraction` fields, restoring parity with the Rust core config

---

## [4.3.6]

### Added

- **Pdfium `PdfParagraph` object-based extraction**: New markdown extraction path using pdfium's `PdfParagraph::from_objects()` for spatial text grouping, replacing raw page-object iteration. Provides accurate per-line baseline positions via `into_lines()` and styled text fragments with bold/italic/monospace detection.
- **Structure tree and content marks API in pdfium-render**: New `ExtractedBlock`, `ContentRole`, and `PdfParagraph` types for tagged PDF semantic extraction. Structure tree headings are validated against font size and word count to prevent broken structure trees from misclassifying body text.
- **Modular markdown pipeline**: Refactored PDF markdown rendering into focused modules — `bridge.rs` (pdfium API bridge), `lines.rs` (baseline grouping), `paragraphs.rs` (paragraph detection), `classify.rs` (heading/code classification), `render.rs` (inline markup), `assembly.rs` (table/image interleaving), `pipeline.rs` (orchestration).
- **Text encoding normalization**: `normalize_text_encoding()` in bridge.rs converts trailing soft hyphens (`\u{00AD}`) to regular hyphens for word-rejoining, strips mid-word soft hyphens, and removes stray C0 control characters from PDF text.
- **Table post-processing validation**: Ported `post_process_table()` from html-to-markdown-rs with 10-stage validation — empty row removal, long cell rejection, data row detection, header extraction, column merging, dimension checks, column sparsity, overall density, content asymmetry, and cell normalization. Eliminates false positive table detections in non-table PDFs.
- **Font quality detection for OCR triggering**: Added `has_unicode_map_error()` to pdfium-render's `PdfPageTextChar`, wrapping `FPDFText_HasUnicodeMapError`. During extraction, characters are sampled per page; if >30% have broken unicode mappings (tofu/garbage), OCR fallback is triggered automatically.
- **Extended list prefix detection**: Paragraph list detection now recognizes en dashes (`–`), em dashes (`—`), single-letter alphabetic prefixes (`a.`, `b)`, `A.`, `B)`), and roman numerals (`i.` through `xii.`).

### Fixed

- **UTF-8 panic in PDF list detection (#398)**: `detect_list_items()` assumed all newlines are 1 byte, causing panics on multi-byte UTF-8 content with CRLF line endings. Fixed with proper CRLF-aware newline advancement and char boundary guards in `process_content()`.
- **PaddleOCR backend not respected in Python bindings (#399)**: `_ensure_ocr_backend_registered()` silently returned without registering for `paddleocr`/`paddle-ocr` backends. These are now correctly skipped like `tesseract`, letting the Rust core handle them.
- **Ruby gem missing `sorbet-runtime` at runtime (#400)**: `sorbet-runtime` was listed as a development dependency in the gemspec but is required at runtime for `T::Struct` types. Promoted to a runtime dependency.
- **E2e generator Ruby rubocop warnings**: The Ruby e2e generator emitted redundant `RSpec/DescribeClass` and `RSpec/ExampleLength` inline disable directives that rubocop autocorrect mangled into invalid syntax. Simplified to only disable `Metrics/BlockLength`.
- **E2e generator TypeScript npm warnings**: Replaced `npx` with `pnpm exec` for running biome in the e2e generator, eliminating spurious warnings from pnpm-specific `.npmrc` settings.
- **Tesseract TSV level mapping off-by-one**: OCR element hierarchy levels were incorrectly mapped — levels are 1=Page, 2=Block, 3=Paragraph, 4=Line, 5=Word. Fixed `parse_tsv_to_elements` to include word-level entries.
- **OCR elements dropped in image OCR path**: `image_ocr.rs` hardcoded `ocr_elements` to `None` instead of passing through the elements parsed from Tesseract TSV output.
- **DOCX extractor panic on multi-byte UTF-8 page boundaries (#401)**: Page break insertion used byte-index slicing on multi-byte UTF-8 content, causing panics. Fixed with char-boundary-safe insertion.
- **Node.js `djot_content` field missing**: `JsExtractionResult` in kreuzberg-node was not mapping the `djot_content` field from Rust results, always returning `undefined`.
- **E2e generator missing `mapPageConfig` and `mapHtmlOptions`**: TypeScript e2e test generator did not map page extraction or HTML formatting options from fixture configs, causing tests with those options to use defaults.
- **Pipeline test race conditions**: Replaced manual `REGISTRY_TEST_GUARD` mutex with `#[serial]` from `serial_test`, fixing flaky failures in `test_pipeline_with_quality_processing`, `test_pipeline_with_all_features`, and `test_postprocessor_runs_before_validator` caused by global registry state pollution between parallel tests.
- **`test_pipeline_with_keyword_extraction` permanently ignored**: Test was marked `#[ignore]` due to test isolation issues. Fixed the underlying problem — `Lazy` static prevented re-registration after `shutdown_all()` — by clearing the processor cache after re-registration.
- **OCR cache deserialization failure**: Added `#[serde(default)]` to `OcrConfidence.detection` field so cached OCR data from before the field was added can still deserialize.
- **CI validate, Rust e2e, Java e2e, and C# e2e failures**: Fixed `ChunkerType` serde casing, populated `djot_content` in pipeline for Djot output format, fixed Java/C# e2e test helper APIs.
- **PDF table detection false positives**: Table detection precision improved from 50% to 100% by applying `post_process_table()` validation to both the pdfium and OCR table detection paths. Non-table PDFs (simple.pdf, fake_memo.pdf, searchable.pdf, google_doc_document.pdf) no longer produce spurious table detections.
- **Baseline tolerance drift in PDF line grouping**: Line grouping tolerance was computed from the minimum font size across all segments in a line, causing it to shrink when subscripts/superscripts were added. Now anchored to the first segment's font size per line.
- **Paragraph gap detection using minimum spacing**: The paragraph break threshold used the minimum inter-line spacing, which was fragile to outlier-tight spacings from superscripts/subscripts. Changed to 25th percentile (Q1) for robustness.

---

## [4.3.5]

### Added

- **PDF markdown output format**: Native PDF text extraction now supports `output_format: Markdown`, producing structured markdown with headings (via font-size clustering), paragraphs, inline bold/italic markup, and list detection — instead of flat text with visual line breaks.
- **Multi-column PDF layout detection**: Histogram-based column gutter detection identifies 2+ column layouts (academic papers, magazines) and processes each column independently, preventing text interleaving across columns.
- **Bold/italic detection via font name fallback**: When PDF font descriptor flags don't indicate bold/italic, the extractor checks font names for "Bold"/"Italic"/"Oblique" substrings and font weight >= 700 as secondary signals.
- **musl/Alpine Linux native builds for Elixir, Java, and C#**: New Docker-based CI jobs build native libraries (`libkreuzberg_rustler.so`, `libkreuzberg_ffi.so`) targeting `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` and `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`. Enables instant install on Alpine Linux and musl-based distributions without compiling from source.
- **Pre-compiled platform-specific Ruby gems**: The publish workflow now ships pre-compiled native gems for `x86_64-linux`, `aarch64-linux`, `arm64-darwin`, and `x64-mingw-ucrt`, eliminating the 30+ minute compile-from-source on `gem install kreuzberg`. A fallback source gem is still published for unsupported platforms.
- **`bounding_box: Option<BoundingBox>` field on `Table` struct**: Added spatial positioning data for table extraction, enabling precise table layout reconstruction. Computed from character positions during PDF table detection.
- **`bounding_box: Option<BoundingBox>` field on `ExtractedImage` struct**: Added spatial positioning data for extracted images, enabling image layout reconstruction in document pipelines.
- **Inline table embedding in PDF markdown output**: Tables are inserted at correct vertical position within markdown content instead of being appended at the end. Position determined by bounding box `y0` coordinate.
- **Image placeholder injection in PDF markdown output**: Image references are inserted with OCR text as blockquotes at correct vertical position matching the image's bounding box.
- **`render_document_as_markdown_with_tables()` function**: New public function for table-aware markdown rendering that embeds tables inline at correct positions and injects image placeholders. Used internally by `render_document_as_markdown()`.
- **`inject_image_placeholders()` function**: New post-processing function for markdown that injects `![Image description]()` placeholders and OCR text blockquotes at correct vertical positions in the content.
- **`bounding_box` field in all language bindings**: Added `bounding_box` (optional `BoundingBox`) to `Table` and `ExtractedImage` types across all 10 language bindings: Python, TypeScript (Node/Core/WASM), Ruby, PHP, Go, Java, C#, and Elixir.

### Fixed

- **Pipeline test flakiness**: Disabled post-processing in pipeline tests that don't test post-processing, fixing `test_pipeline_without_chunking` and related tests that failed due to global processor cache poisoning in parallel execution.
- **PHP FFI bridge missing `bounding_box`**: The PHP Rust bridge (`kreuzberg-php`) was not passing `bounding_box` through for `Table` or `ExtractedImage`, causing the field to always be null despite being defined in the PHP user-facing types.

- **PaddleOCR dict index offset causing wrong character recognition (#395)**: `read_keys_from_file()` was missing the CTC blank token (`#`) at index 0 and the space token at the end, causing off-by-one character mapping errors. Now matches the `get_keys()` layout used for embedded models.
- **PaddleOCR angle classifier misfiring on short text (#395)**: Changed `use_angle_cls` default from `true` to `false`. The angle classifier can misfire on short text regions (e.g., 2-3 character table cells), rotating crops incorrectly before recognition. Users can re-enable via `PaddleOcrConfig::with_angle_cls(true)` for rotated documents.
- **PaddleOCR excessive padding including table gridlines (#395)**: Reduced default detection padding from 50px to 10px and made it configurable via `PaddleOcrConfig::with_padding()`. Large padding on small images caused table gridlines to be included in text crops.
- **Ruby CI Bundler gems destroyed by vendoring script**: The `vendor-kreuzberg-core.py` script was deleting the entire `vendor/` directory including `vendor/bundle/` (Bundler's gem installation). Now only cleans crate subdirectories, preserving Bundler state.
- **PDF document loaded twice for markdown rendering**: Eliminated redundant Pdfium initialization and document parsing by rendering markdown speculatively during the first document load, saving 25-40ms per PDF.
- **NaN panics in PDF text clustering and block merging**: Replaced `expect()` calls on `partial_cmp` with `unwrap_or(Ordering::Equal)` across clustering, extraction, and markdown modules to handle corrupt PDF coordinates gracefully.
- **PDF heading detection false positives**: Added distance threshold to font-size centroid matching — decorative elements with extreme font sizes no longer receive heading levels.
- **PDF list item false positives**: Long paragraphs starting with "1." or "-" no longer misclassified as list items (added line count constraint).
- **Silent markdown fallback**: `tracing::warn` messages for markdown rendering failures are no longer gated behind the `otel` feature flag.
- **PDF font-size clustering float imprecision**: Changed exact `dedup()` to tolerance-based dedup (0.05pt) and added NaN/Inf filtering for font sizes from corrupt PDFs.

- **ExtractionResult typed keyword and quality fields**: `ExtractionResult` now includes typed fields `extracted_keywords: Option<Vec<ExtractedKeyword>>` and `quality_score: Option<f64>` instead of untyped `metadata.additional` entries. Keywords now carry algorithm, score, and position information for better keyword analysis.
- **ProcessingWarning type for extraction pipeline**: New `ProcessingWarning { source: String, message: String }` type added to `ExtractionResult.processing_warnings` to explicitly surface non-fatal warnings during document processing (e.g., recoverable decoding issues, missing optional features).
- **Metadata typed fields**: `Metadata` struct now includes typed fields `category`, `tags`, `document_version`, `abstract_text`, and `output_format` for better structured metadata handling across all language bindings.
- **`output_format` always populated**: The `metadata.output_format` field is now set for all output formats (plain, markdown, djot, html, structured), not just structured. Previously only the structured format populated this field.
- **Language binding updates for typed fields**: All language bindings (Python, TypeScript/Node.js, Ruby, PHP, Go, Java, C#, Elixir) updated with corresponding typed properties matching the Rust API (e.g., `extractedKeywords`, `qualityScore` in TypeScript; `extracted_keywords`, `quality_score` in Python/Ruby).

### Fixed

- **PaddleOCR recognition height mismatch (#390)**: Changed `CRNN_DST_HEIGHT` from 32 to 48 pixels to match PP-OCRv4/v5 model input shape `[batch, 3, 48, width]`. The previous value caused ONNX Runtime dimension errors on all platforms.
- **Go binding: `ChunkingConfig` missing `Embedding` field**: Added `Embedding *EmbeddingConfig` to Go's `ChunkingConfig` struct to match the Rust canonical type. Previously, embedding configuration nested inside chunking was silently dropped during JSON round-trip, causing embedding-enabled extractions to run without embeddings.
- **Go binding: `extracted_keywords`, `quality_score`, `processing_warnings` always nil**: The vendored C header (`packages/go/v4/internal/ffi/kreuzberg.h`) was missing the three new `CExtractionResult` fields, and `convertCResult()` never decoded them. Updated the header and added the missing `decodeJSONCString` calls.
- **`extraction_duration_ms` missing from Go, Java, PHP, C# bindings**: The `Metadata.extraction_duration_ms` field was present in Rust, TypeScript, and Elixir but absent from four bindings. Added the field with proper serialization/deserialization to all four.
- **C# `Metadata.Additional` not marked obsolete**: The deprecated `additional` map (superseded by typed fields) was not marked `[Obsolete]` in C#. Added `[Obsolete]` attribute matching the Rust deprecation. Also added `@Deprecated` in Java and `// Deprecated:` doc comment in Go.
- **Ruby RBS type signatures incomplete**: `packages/ruby/sig/kreuzberg.rbs` lacked struct definitions for all T::Struct types (`ExtractedKeyword`, `ProcessingWarning`, `BoundingBox`, `DocumentNode`, etc.) and inner result classes (`Table`, `Chunk`, `OcrElement`, etc.). Rewrote with comprehensive type definitions matching `types.rb` and `result.rb`.
- **Python `.pyi` stub missing `extraction_duration_ms`**: Added `extraction_duration_ms: int | None` to the `Metadata` TypedDict in `_internal_bindings.pyi`.

### Changed

- **PDF table extraction now computes bounding boxes from character positions**: Table bounding box is calculated as the aggregate bounds of all constituent character positions, enabling precise spatial positioning in downstream rendering pipelines.
- **`render_document_as_markdown()` now delegates to `render_document_as_markdown_with_tables()` with empty tables**: The original function is now a thin wrapper for backward compatibility, with all table-aware rendering logic centralized in the new `_with_tables()` variant.

- **PaddleOCR recognition models upgraded to PP-OCRv5**: Upgraded arabic, devanagari, tamil, and telugu recognition models from PP-OCRv3 to PP-OCRv5 for improved accuracy. All 11 script families now use PP-OCRv5 models.
- **PDFium upgraded to chromium/7678**: Upgraded PDFium binary version from 7578 to the latest release (chromium/7678, Feb 2026) across all CI workflows, Docker images, and task configuration. C API is fully backward-compatible with existing bindings.
- **kreuzberg-pdfium-render trimmed to single version**: Removed support for 22 legacy PDFium API versions (5961-7350 + future), deleting ~328k lines of dead code including bindgen files, C headers, and ~4,256 version-conditional compilation blocks. Removed XFA, V8, Skia, and Win32 feature-gated code paths.
- **Workspace dependency consolidation**: Moved `wasm-bindgen`, `wasm-bindgen-futures`, `js-sys`, `web-sys`, `console_error_panic_hook`, and `log` to workspace-level dependency management, deduplicating versions across `kreuzberg-pdfium-render`, `kreuzberg-wasm`, and `kreuzberg-ffi`.
- **Docker full image: pre-download all PaddleOCR models**: Replaced broken single-language model download with all 11 recognition script families (english, chinese, latin, korean, eslav, thai, greek, arabic, devanagari, tamil, telugu) plus dictionaries. Fixed incorrect HuggingFace URLs and cache paths. Added retry logic with backoff for transient HuggingFace 502 errors.
- **Docker test suite: PaddleOCR verification**: Added `test_paddle_ocr_extraction` to the full variant Docker tests to verify pre-loaded models work end-to-end.
- **E2E tests updated for typed extraction fields**: End-to-end tests now validate typed `extracted_keywords`, `quality_score`, and `processing_warnings` fields instead of reading from `metadata.additional` dictionary.

---

## [4.3.4] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

- **Node.js keyword extraction fields missing**: The TypeScript `convertResult()` type converter was silently dropping `extractedKeywords`, `qualityScore`, and `processingWarnings` from NAPI results because it only copied explicitly listed fields. Added the missing field conversions. Also renamed the mismatched `keywords` property to `extractedKeywords` in the TypeScript types to match the NAPI binding definition.
- **Windows PHP CI build failure (`crc::Table` not found)**: Downgraded `lzma-rust2` from 0.16.1 to 0.15.7 to avoid pulling `crc` 3.4.0, which removed the `Table` type used by downstream dependencies.
- **CLI installer resolving benchmark tags as latest release**: The `install.sh` script used GitHub's `/releases/latest` API which returned benchmark run releases instead of actual versioned releases. Changed to filter for `v`-prefixed tags. Also marked benchmark releases as prerelease in the workflow so they no longer interfere.

---

## [4.3.3] - 2026-02-14

### Added

#### Centralized Image OCR Processing
- **Shared `process_images_with_ocr` function**: Extracted duplicated OCR processing logic from DOCX and PPTX extractors into `extraction::image_ocr` module, providing a single shared implementation for all document extractors.

#### Jupyter Notebook Image Extraction
- **Base64 image decoding**: Jupyter extractor now decodes embedded base64 image data (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP) from notebook cell outputs into `ExtractedImage` structs instead of emitting placeholder text.
- **OCR on notebook images**: Extracted images are processed with OCR when configured, using the centralized `process_images_with_ocr` function.
- **SVG handling**: SVG images in notebook outputs are handled as text content (not sent to raster OCR).

#### Markdown Data URI Image Extraction
- **Data URI image decoding**: Markdown extractor now decodes `data:image/...;base64,...` URIs into `ExtractedImage` structs with proper format detection (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP).
- **OCR on embedded images**: Decoded data URI images are processed with OCR when configured.
- **HTTP URLs preserved as text**: Non-data URIs (HTTP/HTTPS) are kept as `[Image: url]` text markers without attempting network access or filesystem traversal.

#### PaddleOCR Multi-Language Support (#388)
- **80+ language support via 11 script families**: PaddleOCR recognition models now cover english, chinese (simplified+traditional+japanese), latin, korean, east slavic (cyrillic), thai, greek, arabic, devanagari, tamil, and telugu script families.
- **Per-family recognition model architecture**: Shared detection/classification models with per-family recognition models and dictionaries, downloaded on demand from HuggingFace (`Kreuzberg/paddleocr-onnx-models`).
- **Engine pool for concurrent multi-language OCR**: Replaced single-engine architecture with a per-family engine pool (`HashMap<String, Arc<Mutex<OcrLite>>>`), enabling concurrent OCR across different languages.
- **Backend-agnostic `--ocr-language` CLI flag**: Works with all OCR backends (tesseract, paddle-ocr, easyocr). Tesseract expects ISO 639-3 codes (eng, fra, deu); PaddleOCR accepts flexible codes (en, ch, french, korean) via `map_language_code()`.
- **SHA256 checksum verification**: All model downloads verified against embedded checksums for integrity.

### Changed

#### PaddleOCR Engine Internals
- **CrnnNet recognition height**: Changed to 32 pixels (later found to be incorrect for PP-OCRv4/v5 models; fixed in next release).
- **Model manager split**: `MODELS` constant replaced with `SHARED_MODELS` (det+cls) and `REC_MODELS` (11 families) with new cache layout `rec/{family}/model.onnx`.
- **Language code mapping expanded**: `map_language_code()` now handles Thai, Greek, East Slavic, and additional Latin-script languages.

#### DOCX Full Extraction Pipeline (#387)
- **DocumentStructure generation**: Builds hierarchical document tree with heading-based sections, paragraphs, lists, tables, images, headers/footers, and footnotes/endnotes when `include_document_structure = true`.
- **Pages field population**: Splits extracted text into per-page `PageContent` entries using detected page break boundaries, with tables and images assigned to correct pages.
- **OCR on embedded images**: Runs secondary OCR on extracted DOCX images when OCR is configured, following the PPTX pattern.
- **Image extraction with page assignment**: Drawing image placeholders in markdown output enable byte-position-based page number assignment for extracted images.
- **Typed metadata fields**: `title`, `subject`, `authors`, `created_by`, `modified_by`, `created_at`, `modified_at`, `language`, and `keywords` are now populated as first-class `Metadata` fields instead of only appearing in the `additional` map.
- **FormatMetadata::Docx**: Structured format metadata with `core_properties`, `app_properties`, and `custom_properties` available via `metadata.format`.
- **Style-based heading detection**: Uses `StyleCatalog` with `outline_level` and inheritance chain walking for accurate heading level resolution, with string-matching fallback.
- **Headers, footers, and footnote references**: Headers/footers included in markdown with `---` separators; `[^N]` inline footnote/endnote references rendered in text.
- **Markdown formatting**: Bold (`**`), italic (`*`), underline (`<u>`), strikethrough (`~~`), and hyperlinks rendered as markdown.
- **Table formatting metadata**: Vertical merge (`v_merge`) handled correctly, `grid_span` for horizontal merging, `is_header` row detection.
- **Drawing image placeholders**: `![alt](image_N)` placeholders in markdown output for embedded images.


#### DOCX Extractor Performance & Code Quality
- **Eliminated 3x code duplication**: Extracted `parse_docx_core()` helper to deduplicate parsing logic across tokio/non-tokio cfg branches.
- **Removed unnecessary clones**: Metadata structs (core/app/custom properties) borrowed then moved instead of cloned; drawings and image relationships only cloned when image extraction is enabled.
- **Optimized Run::to_markdown()**: Single-pass string builder with pre-calculated capacity replaces clone + repeated `format!` calls on the hot path.
- **In-place output trimming**: `to_markdown()` trims in-place instead of allocating a new String via `trim().to_string()`.
- **Removed `into_owned()` on XML text decode**: Uses `Cow` directly from `e.decode()` instead of forcing heap allocation.
- **`write!`/`writeln!` for string building**: Footnote definitions and image placeholders use `write!` to avoid intermediate String allocations.
- **Safe element indexing**: `to_markdown()` uses `.get()` with `else { continue }` instead of direct indexing to prevent potential panics.
- **Deduplicated document structure code**: Header/footer loops and footnote/endnote loops consolidated using iterators.

### Fixed

#### Extraction Quality Improvements
- **LaTeX zero-arg command handling**: Added explicit skip list for 35 zero-argument commands (`\par`, `\noindent`, `\centering`, size commands, etc.). The catch-all handler no longer consumes the next `{...}` group as an argument, preventing silent text loss for unknown zero-arg commands.
- **Structured data `is_text_field` false positives**: Changed from `.contains()` substring matching to exact equality on the leaf field name. Previously, "width" matched because it contains "id"; "valid" matched because it contains "id". Now only exact leaf name matches are considered.
- **XML dead code in `Event::End` handler**: Removed unused variable allocation and discarded comparison (`let _ = popped == name_owned`), replaced with simple `element_stack.pop()`.

### Removed
- **Dead code cleanup**: Removed unused `Document.lists` field, `ListItem` struct, `process_lists()` method, and `HeaderFooter::extract_text()` method.

---

## [4.3.2] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed

#### PHP 8.4 Requirement Update
- **Updated PHP requirement to 8.4+**: All PHP composer.json files, CI workflows, and documentation now require PHP 8.4+ to support PHPUnit 13.0. This fixes CI validation and PHP workflow failures caused by PHPUnit 13.0 requiring PHP 8.4.1+.

#### Elixir Publishing Workflow
- **Fixed macOS ARM64 build timeout**: Increased timeout from 180 to 300 minutes (5 hours) for macOS ARM64 Elixir native library builds. The previous timeout caused incomplete builds and prevented Elixir v4.3.1 from being published to Hex.pm.

---

## [4.3.1] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed

#### Elixir Package Checksums (#383)
- **Fixed checksum mismatch for Elixir 4.3.0 Hex package**: Updated `checksum-Elixir.Kreuzberg.Native.exs` with correct SHA256 checksums for all 8 precompiled NIF binaries (NIF 2.16/2.17 across aarch64-apple-darwin, aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu, x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, x86_64-pc-windows-gnu). The 4.3.0 release shipped with outdated 4.2.10 checksums, causing installation failures.

#### Dependency Updates
- **Updated all dependencies across 10 language ecosystems**: Rust, Python, Node/TypeScript, Ruby, PHP, Go, Java, C#, Elixir, WASM, and pre-commit hooks all updated to latest compatible versions.
- **Enhanced dependency update tasks**: All language-specific `task update` commands now upgrade to latest major versions (not just respecting version constraints). PHP, Ruby, C#, Elixir, and Python update tasks enhanced with major version upgrade support.

#### WASM Compatibility
- **Fixed WASM build failures**: Added explicit `getrandom 0.3.4` dependency with `wasm_js` feature to `kreuzberg-wasm` crate to ensure transitive dependencies (ahash, lopdf, rand_core) have WebAssembly support enabled.

#### Dependency Pins
- **Pinned lzma-rust2 to 0.15.7**: The 0.16.1 upgrade is incompatible with crc 3.4.0. Keeping 0.15.7 until upstream compatibility is restored.

---

## [4.3.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added

#### Blank Page Detection
- **`is_blank` field on `PageInfo` and `PageContent`**: Pages with fewer than 3 non-whitespace characters and no tables or images are flagged as blank. Detection uses a two-phase approach: text-only analysis during extraction, then refinement after table/image assignment. Available across all 9 language bindings (Python, TypeScript, Ruby, Java, Go, C#, PHP, Elixir, WASM). Closes #378.

#### PaddleOCR Backend
- **PaddleOCR backend via ONNX Runtime**: New OCR backend (`kreuzberg-paddle-ocr`) using PaddlePaddle's PP-OCRv4 models converted to ONNX format, run via ONNX Runtime. Supports 6 languages (English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, French) with automatic model downloading and caching. Provides superior CJK recognition compared to Tesseract.
- **PaddleOCR support in all bindings**: Available across Python, Rust, TypeScript/Node.js, Go, Java, PHP, Ruby, C#, and Elixir bindings via the `paddle-ocr` feature flag.
- **PaddleOCR CLI support**: The `kreuzberg-cli` binary supports `--ocr-backend paddle-ocr` for PaddleOCR extraction.

#### Unified OCR Element Output
- **Structured OCR element data**: Extraction results now include `OcrElement` data with bounding geometry (rectangles and quadrilaterals), per-element confidence scores, rotation information, and hierarchical levels (word, line, block, page). Available from both PaddleOCR and Tesseract backends.

#### Shared ONNX Runtime Discovery
- **`ort_discovery` module**: Finds ONNX Runtime shared libraries across platforms, shared between PaddleOCR and future ONNX-based backends.

#### Document Structure Output
- **`DocumentStructure` support across all bindings**: Added structured document output with `include_document_structure` configuration option across Python, TypeScript/Node.js, Go, Java, PHP, Ruby, C#, Elixir, and WASM bindings.

#### Native DOC/PPT Extraction
- **OLE/CFB-based extraction**: Added native DOC and PPT extraction via OLE/CFB binary parsing. Legacy Office formats no longer require any external tools.

#### musl Linux Support
- **Re-enabled musl targets**: Added `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` and `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` targets for CLI binaries, Python wheels (musllinux), and Node.js native bindings. Resolves glibc 2.38+ requirement for prebuilt CLI binaries on older distros like Ubuntu 22.04 (#364).

### Fixed

#### MSG Extraction Hang on Large Attachments (#372)
- Fixed `.msg` (Outlook) extraction hanging indefinitely on files with large attachments. Replaced the `msg_parser` crate with direct OLE/CFB parsing using the `cfb` crate — attachment binary data is now read directly without hex-encoding overhead.
- Added lenient FAT padding for MSG files with truncated sector tables produced by some Outlook versions.

#### Rotated PDF Text Extraction
- Fixed text extraction returning empty content for PDFs with 90° or 270° page rotation. Kreuzberg now strips `/Rotate` entries from page dictionaries before loading, restoring correct text extraction for all rotation angles.

#### CSV and Excel Extraction Quality
- Fixed CSV extraction producing near-zero quality scores (0.024) by outputting proper delimited text instead of debug format.
- Fixed Excel extraction producing low quality scores (0.22) by outputting clean tab/newline-delimited cell text.

#### XML Extraction Quality
- Improved XML text extraction to better handle namespaced elements, CDATA sections, and mixed content, improving quality scores.

#### WASM Table Extraction
- Fixed WASM adapter not recognizing `page_number` field (snake_case) from Rust FFI, causing table data to be silently dropped in Deno and Cloudflare Workers tests.

#### DOCX Formatting Output (#376)
- Fixed DOCX extraction producing plain text instead of formatted markdown. Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, and hyperlinks are now rendered with proper markdown markers (`**bold**`, `*italic*`, `~~strikethrough~~`, `[text](url)`).
- Fixed heading hierarchy: Title style maps to `#`, Heading1 to `##`, through Heading5+ clamped at `######`.
- Fixed bullet lists (`- `), numbered lists (`1. `), and nested list indentation (2-space per level).
- Fixed tables missing from markdown output. Tables are now interleaved with paragraphs in document order and rendered as markdown pipe tables.
- Fixed table cell formatting being stripped — bold/italic inside table cells is now preserved.
- Added 16 integration tests covering formatting, headings, lists, tables, and document structure.

#### Typst Table Content Extraction
- Fixed Typst `extract_table_content` double-counting opening parenthesis, which caused the table parser to consume all remaining document content after a `#table()` call.

#### PaddleOCR Recognition Model
- Fixed PaddleOCR recognition model (`en_PP-OCRv4_rec_infer.onnx`) failing to load with `ShapeInferenceError` on ONNX Runtime 1.23.x.
- Fixed incorrect detection model filename in Docker and CI action (`en_PP-OCRv4_det_infer.onnx` → `ch_PP-OCRv4_det_infer.onnx`).

#### Python Bindings
- Fixed `OcrConfig` constructor silently ignoring `paddle_ocr_config` and `element_config` keyword arguments.
- Fixed keyword extraction results (and all `metadata.additional` entries from post-processors) being silently dropped in Python bindings. The `ExtractionResult.from_rust()` method now propagates flattened additional metadata fields, matching all other bindings. Closes #379.

#### TypeScript/Node.js Bindings
- Fixed PaddleOCR config (`paddle_ocr_config`) and element config (`element_config`) being silently dropped by the NAPI-RS binding layer.
- Fixed `ocr_elements` missing from extraction result conversion in TypeScript wrapper.

#### Ruby Bindings
- Fixed `kreuzberg-pdfium-render` vendored crate not included in gemspec, causing gem build failures.
- Fixed PaddleOCR config and element config not being parsed in Ruby binding config layer.
- Fixed `ocr_elements` missing from Ruby extraction result conversion.

#### Go Bindings
- Fixed `PdfMetadata` deserialization failing when keyword extraction produces object arrays instead of simple strings. Added lenient `UnmarshalJSON` fallback with field-by-field recovery.

#### C# Bindings
- Fixed keyword extraction data inaccessible in C# — `ExtractedKeywords` was marked `[JsonIgnore]` and excluded from metadata serialization. Added lenient metadata extraction fallback for mixed-type keyword fields.

#### PHP Bindings
- Fixed `document`, `elements`, and `ocrElements` properties inaccessible on `ExtractionResult` — these fields were not exposed through the `__get` handler.
- Fixed `ExtractionConfig::toArray()` not serializing `include_document_structure`, causing document structure extraction to be silently ignored.
- Fixed wrapper function names for document extractor management (`kreuzberg_*_document_extractors` → `kreuzberg_*_extractors`).
- Added missing OCR backend management functions (`kreuzberg_list_ocr_backends`, `kreuzberg_clear_ocr_backends`, `kreuzberg_unregister_ocr_backend`).
- Fixed `page_count` metadata key mismatch between serialization (`pageCount`) and deserialization (`page_count`).

#### Elixir Bindings
- Fixed NIF config parser not forwarding `include_document_structure`, `result_format`, `output_format`, `html_options`, `max_concurrent_extractions`, and `security_limits` options.
- Added missing document extractor management NIFs (`list_document_extractors`, `unregister_document_extractor`, `clear_document_extractors`).

#### CI
- Fixed PHP E2E tests not actually running in CI — the task was configured to run package unit tests instead of E2E tests.

### Changed

#### Build System
- Bumped ONNX Runtime from 1.23.2 to 1.24.1 across CI, Docker images, and documentation.
- Bumped vendored Tesseract from 5.5.1 to 5.5.2.
- Bumped vendored Leptonica from 1.86.0 to 1.87.0.

### Removed

#### LibreOffice Dependency
- **LibreOffice is no longer required**: Legacy .doc and .ppt files are now extracted natively via OLE/CFB parsing. LibreOffice has been removed from Docker images, CI pipelines, and system dependency requirements, reducing the full Docker image size by ~500-800MB. Users on Kreuzberg <4.3 still need LibreOffice for these formats.

#### `msg_parser` Dependency
- Replaced `msg_parser` crate with direct CFB parsing for MSG extraction. Eliminates hex-encoding overhead and reduces dependency count.

#### Guten OCR Backend
- Removed all references to the unused Guten OCR backend from Node.js and PHP bindings. Renamed `KREUZBERG_DEBUG_GUTEN` env var to `KREUZBERG_DEBUG_OCR`.

---

## [4.2.15] - 2026-02-08

### Added

#### Agent Skill for AI Coding Assistants

- **Agent Skill for document extraction**: Added `skills/kreuzberg/SKILL.md` following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard, with comprehensive instructions for Python, Node.js, Rust, and CLI usage. Includes 8 detailed reference files covering API signatures, configuration, supported formats, plugins, and all language bindings. Works with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, VS Code, Amp, Goose, Roo Code, and any compatible tool.

#### MIME Type Mappings
- Added `.docbook` (`application/docbook+xml`) and `.jats` (`application/x-jats+xml`) file extension mappings.

### Fixed

#### ODT List and Section Extraction
- Fixed ODT extractor not handling `text:list` and `text:section` elements. Documents containing bulleted/numbered lists or sections returned empty content.

#### UTF-16 EML Parsing
- Fixed EML files encoded in UTF-16 (LE/BE, with or without BOM) returning empty content. Detects UTF-16 encoding via BOM markers and heuristic byte-pattern analysis, transcoding to UTF-8 before parsing.

#### Email Attachment Metadata Serialization
- Fixed email extraction inserting a comma-joined string `"attachments"` into the `additional` metadata HashMap, which via `#[serde(flatten)]` overwrote the structured `EmailMetadata.attachments` array. This caused deserialization failures in Go, C#, and other typed bindings when processing emails with attachments.

#### WASM Office Document Support (DOCX, PPTX, ODT)
- DOCX, PPTX, and ODT extractors were gated on `#[cfg(all(feature = "tokio-runtime", feature = "office"))]` but `wasm-target` does not enable `tokio-runtime`. Changed cfg gates to `#[cfg(feature = "office")]` with conditional `spawn_blocking` only when `tokio-runtime` is available. Office documents now extract correctly in WASM builds.

#### WASM PDF Support in Non-Browser Runtimes
- PDFium initialization was guarded by `isBrowser()`, preventing PDF extraction in Node.js, Bun, and Deno. Removed the browser-only restriction so PDFium auto-initializes in all WASM runtimes.

#### Elixir PageBoundary JSON Serialization
- Added missing `@derive Jason.Encoder` to `PageBoundary`, `PageInfo`, and `PageStructure` structs in the Elixir bindings. Without this, encoding page structure metadata to JSON would fail with a protocol error.

#### Pre-built CLI Binary Missing MCP Command
- Pre-built standalone CLI binaries were built without the `mcp` feature flag, causing the `kreuzberg mcp` command to be unavailable. The build script now enables all features (`--features all`) to match the Python, Node, and Homebrew builds. Fixes #369.

#### PDF Error Handling Regression
- Reverted incorrect change from v4.2.14 that silently returned empty results for corrupted/malformed PDFs instead of propagating errors. Corrupted PDFs now correctly return `PdfError::InvalidPdf` and password-protected PDFs return `PdfError::PasswordRequired` as expected.

### Changed

#### API Parity
- Added `security_limits` field to all 9 language bindings (TypeScript, Go, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, C#, WASM, Elixir) for API parity with Rust core `ExtractionConfig`.

---

## [4.2.14] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

#### Excel File-Path Extraction
- Fixed `.xla` (legacy add-in) and `.xlsb` (binary spreadsheet) graceful fallback only applied to byte-based extraction; file-path-based extraction still propagated parse errors.

#### PDF Test Flakiness
- Fixed flaky PDF tests caused by concurrent pdfium access during parallel test execution. Added `#[serial]` to all pdfium-using tests to prevent global state conflicts.

#### Benchmark Fixtures
- Replaced auto-generated fixture discovery (`generate.rs`) with curated, validated fixture set.
- Added comprehensive fixture validation test suite (8 tests: JSON parsing, document existence, file sizes, ground truth, duplicate detection, format coverage).
- Removed 5 duplicate fixture entries pointing to the same test documents.
- Swapped encrypted EPUB fixture (`epub2_no_cover.epub` with IDPF font encryption) for clean `features.epub`.
- Fixed 272 stale `file_size` declarations in fixture JSON files to match actual files on disk.
- Fixed `validate_ground_truth.py` only checking root-level fixtures; now uses `rglob` for recursive validation.

### Removed
- Removed `generate.rs` auto-generation system from benchmark harness (caused recurring breakage from malformed vendored files).

---

## [4.2.13] - 2026-02-07

### Added

#### WASM Office Format Support
- Added office document extraction to the WASM target: DOCX, PPTX, RTF, reStructuredText, Org-mode, FictionBook, Typst, BibTeX, and Markdown are now available in the browser/WASM build.
- Added WASM integration tests for all new office formats (`office_extraction.rs`).
- Added e2e fixture definitions for RTF, RST, Org, FB2, Typst, BibTeX, and Markdown formats.
- Regenerated e2e test suites across all language bindings to include new office format fixtures.

#### Citation Extraction
- Added structured citation extraction for RIS (`.ris`), PubMed/MEDLINE (`.nbib`), and EndNote XML (`.enw`) formats via `biblib` crate with rich metadata including authors, DOI, year, keywords, and abstract.
- Added `CitationExtractor` with priority 60 for `application/x-research-info-systems`, `application/x-pubmed`, and `application/x-endnote+xml` MIME types.

#### JPEG 2000 OCR Support
- Added full JPEG 2000 image decoding for OCR via `hayro-jpeg2000` (pure Rust, memory-safe decoder). JP2 container and J2K codestream images are now decoded to RGB pixels for Tesseract OCR processing.
- Added pure Rust JP2 metadata parsing (dimensions, format detection) without external dependencies.

#### JBIG2 Image Support
- Added JBIG2 bi-level image decoding for OCR via `hayro-jbig2` (pure Rust, memory-safe decoder). JBIG2 is commonly used in scanned PDF documents.
- Added `image/x-jbig2` MIME type with `.jbig2` and `.jb2` file extension mappings.

#### Gzip Archive Extraction
- Added `GzipExtractor` for extracting text content from gzip-compressed files (`.gz`) via `flate2`, with decompression size limits to prevent gzip bomb attacks.

#### Extractor Registration
- Registered `JatsExtractor` and `DocbookExtractor` in the default extractor registry (extractors existed but were never registered).

#### MIME Type & Extension Mappings
- Added missing MIME types to `SUPPORTED_MIME_TYPES`: `text/x-fictionbook`, `application/x-fictionbook`, `text/x-bibtex`, `text/docbook`, `application/x-pubmed`.
- Added MIME type aliases for broader compatibility: `text/djot`, `text/jats`, `application/x-epub+zip`, `application/vnd.epub+zip`, `text/rtf`, `text/prs.fallenstein.rst`, `text/x-tex`, `text/org`, `application/x-org`, `application/xhtml+xml`, `text/x-typst`, `image/jpg`.
- Added missing file extension mappings: `.fb2`, `.opml`, `.dbk`, `.j2k`, `.j2c`, `.ris`, `.nbib`, `.enw`, `.typ`, `.djot`.

#### Security
- Wired `SecurityLimits` into the archive extraction pipeline: ZIP, TAR, 7z, and GZIP extractors now enforce configurable limits for max archive size, file count, compression ratio, and content size.
- Added `security_limits` field to `ExtractionConfig` for user-configurable archive security thresholds.
- ZIP archives are now validated with `ZipBombValidator` before extraction.
- Replaced hardcoded 256 MB gzip decompression limit with configurable `max_archive_size` (default 500 MB).

### Fixed

#### WASM Build
- Fixed `zstd-sys` build failure for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` by disabling default features on the `zip` crate and using `deflate-flate2` (pure Rust) instead of `zstd` (C code incompatible with WASM).
- Fixed `tokio`/`mio` compilation failure on WASM by removing `tokio-runtime` from the `office` feature (only needed for LibreOffice subprocess conversion, not in-memory parsers).
- Gated LibreOffice conversion paths (`libreoffice.rs`, legacy DOC/PPT handlers) behind `not(target_arch = "wasm32")` to prevent WASM builds from pulling in tokio filesystem and process APIs.

#### MIME Type Detection
- Fixed `.typ` files not recognized as Typst format; added `.typ` as an alias for `application/x-typst`.
- Fixed `.djot` files not recognized; added `.djot` extension mapping to `text/x-djot`.
- Fixed `application/gzip` rejected by MIME validation; added to `SUPPORTED_MIME_TYPES`.
- Fixed case-sensitive MIME type validation rejecting valid types with different casing (e.g., `macroEnabled` vs `macroenabled`); added RFC 2045 case-insensitive fallback.
- Synced `SUPPORTED_MIME_TYPES` with extractor registry to prevent valid formats being rejected before reaching their extractor.

#### Image Extraction
- Fixed JPEG 2000 images (`.jp2`) not handled by ImageExtractor; added `image/jp2`, `image/jpx`, `image/jpm`, and `image/mj2` to supported types.

#### Extraction
- Fixed YAML files rejected with "Unsupported format: application/yaml"; now accepts all four YAML MIME type variants including the standard `application/yaml` (RFC 9512).

#### CLI
- Fixed `.yml` config files rejected by `--config` flag; now accepts both `.yml` and `.yaml`.

#### .tgz Archive Extraction
- Fixed `.tgz` files parsed as raw TAR instead of gzip-compressed TAR. The MIME mapping now correctly routes `.tgz` to the GzipExtractor, which detects inner TAR archives via ustar magic bytes and delegates to TAR extraction.

#### Excel Exotic Formats
- Fixed `.xlam` (Excel add-in), `.xla` (legacy add-in), and `.xlsb` (binary spreadsheet) files causing extraction errors when they lack standard workbook data. These formats now gracefully return an empty workbook instead of propagating parse errors.

#### PDF Error Handling
- Fixed password-protected and malformed PDFs causing extraction errors. The PDF extractor now gracefully returns an empty `ExtractionResult` instead of propagating `PdfError::PasswordRequired` and `PdfError::InvalidPdf`.

#### Benchmark Harness
- Fixed framework initialization check running before external adapters (Tika, pdfplumber, etc.) were registered, causing false "failed to initialize" errors.
- Fixed missing `composer install` step in PHP benchmark CI job.
- Fixed C# benchmark wrapper using wrong MIME type casing for macro-enabled Office formats and incorrect djot MIME type.
- Fixed WASM benchmark wrapper missing MIME mappings for several supported formats.
- Added error counts (`framework_errors`, `harness_errors`) and error detail breakdown to benchmark aggregation output.
- Added distinct `ErrorKind::Timeout` tracking in benchmark results, propagated through aggregation and per-extension stats.
- Removed 12 malformed/password-protected/broken fixture files from benchmark corpus.

## [4.2.12] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

#### DOCX Extraction
- Fixed DOCX list items missing whitespace between text runs, causing words to merge together. (#359)

---

## [4.2.11] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

#### Python Bindings
- Fixed CLI binary missing from all platform wheels in the publish workflow. (#349)

### Fixed

#### OCR Heuristic

- **Pass actual page count to OCR fallback evaluator**: `evaluate_native_text_for_ocr` was called with `None` for page count, defaulting to 1. This inflated per-page averages for multi-page documents, causing scanned PDFs to skip OCR.
- **Per-page OCR evaluation for mixed-content PDFs**: Added `evaluate_per_page_ocr` which evaluates each page independently using page boundaries. If any single page triggers OCR fallback, the entire document is OCR'd. Previously, good pages masked scanned pages in the aggregate evaluation.

---

## [4.2.10] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

#### Python Bindings
- Fixed "embedded binary not found" error on Windows due to missing `.exe` extension handling. (#349)

#### OCR Heuristic
- Fixed OCR fallback evaluator receiving `None` for page count, causing scanned PDFs to incorrectly skip OCR.
- Added per-page OCR evaluation so that mixed-content PDFs with some scanned pages are properly OCR'd.

---

## [4.2.8] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed

#### Python Bindings
- Fixed `ChunkingConfig` serialization outputting wrong field names (`max_characters`/`overlap` instead of `max_chars`/`max_overlap`).

#### Java Bindings
- Fixed ARM64 SIGBUS crash in `kreuzberg_get_error_details` by returning a heap-allocated pointer instead of struct-by-value.

#### Ruby Bindings
- Fixed `rb_sys` missing as runtime dependency, causing `LoadError` during native extension compilation.

#### FFI
- Added `kreuzberg_free_error_details()` to properly free heap-allocated `CErrorDetails` structs.

---

## [4.2.7] - 2026-02-01

### Added

### Changed

- Bumped `html-to-markdown-rs` from 2.24.1 to 2.24.3.

### Performance

- Converted static string fields to `Cow<'static, str>` to eliminate heap allocations for string literals.
- Reduced allocations in RST parser, fictionbook extractor, and email extractor.
- Replaced `HashMap` with `Vec` for small metadata maps and `AHashMap` for hot-path maps.
- Switched `Metadata.additional` keys to `Cow<'static, str>` for interning.
- Replaced `Vec<u8>` with `bytes::Bytes` for `ExtractedImage.data`, enabling zero-copy cloning.

---

### Fixed

#### Python Bindings
- Fixed missing `output_format`/`result_format` fields on `ExtractionResult`.
- Fixed missing `elements` and `djot_content` fields on `ExtractionResult`.
- Fixed chunks returned as dicts instead of objects; created proper `PyChunk` class with attribute access.

#### WASM Bindings
- Added `outputFormat`, `resultFormat`, and `htmlOptions` to `ExtractionConfig` interface.

### Documentation

- Added Kubernetes deployment guide with health check configuration and troubleshooting. ([#328](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg/issues/328))

---
