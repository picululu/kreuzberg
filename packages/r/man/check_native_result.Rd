\title{Check if a native result is an extendr error condition and raise it}
\usage{
check_native_result(result)
}
\arguments{
\item{result}{The result from a native function call.}
}
\value{
The result if not an error; otherwise stops with a typed condition.
}
\description{
When the extendr \code{result_condition} feature is enabled, Rust errors are
returned as R objects with class "extendr_error" rather than being raised.
This function detects those conditions and re-raises them as proper R errors.
}
\details{
Typed error prefixes (e.g., \verb{[ValidationError]}) from the Rust side are
parsed to create specific R condition classes, enabling targeted error
handling with \code{tryCatch()}.
