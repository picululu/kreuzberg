data







HIP 13044 is a red
horizontal-branch
star about 2,300
light years
(700 pc) from
Earth in the
constellation
Fornax.[3][6]
The star is part of the
Helmi stream, a former
dwarf galaxy
that merged with the
Milky Way
between six and nine billion years ago.[7]
As a result, HIP 13044 circles the
Galactic Center
at a highly irregular orbit with respect to the
galactic plane. HIP 13044 is slightly less massive than the Sun, but is
approximately seven times its size. The star, which is
estimated to be at least nine billion years old, has passed
the
red-giant
phase. The relatively fast rotation of the star may be due
to having engulfed one or more planets during the red-giant
phase.[7]






Observational history

[edit]




A science team from the
Max Planck Institute for Astronomy
first observed HIP 13044 using
Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph
(FEROS) at the
European Southern Observatory's
La Silla Observatory
in Chile. The first follow-up led to the collection of 36
radial velocity
measurements taken between September 2009 and July 2010.[7]




The team also used
photometric
data that had been passively collected by and publicly
released into the archive of the
SuperWASP
collaboration, which had been observing the region where the
star was located. In this data, HIP 13044 was found to
oscillate; the signal was blocked roughly every sixteen
days. Analysis of the SuperWASP and FEROS data led to the
supposed discovery of the planet HIP 13044 b,[7]
although this claim was later refuted.





Characteristics

[edit]




HIP 13044 is an
F-type
star located approximately 701
parsecs (2,286
light years) from Earth in the
Helmi stream[7]—a group of low-metallicity stars moving with large
velocities relative to the Sun. The star follows an
eccentric galactic orbit, with a distance from the galactic
center ranging from 7 to 16
kiloparsecs.[8]
The orbit does not lie in the
galactic plane, and can reach distances as high as 13 kpc above it.
This indicates that it once was part of a satellite galaxy
of the
Milky Way
that was disrupted 6–9 billion years ago.[3]
The star itself is estimated to be at least nine billion
years old.[8]




HIP 13044 is fairly evolved star
fusing helium
in its core, and has therefore already passed the
red-giant
phase of its evolution.[3]
It lies near the blue end of the red horizontal branch
bordering the
instability strip.[3]
Its surface temperature is about 6025 K and its radius
is approximately 6.7
solar radii. HIP 13044's mass is estimated to be 0.8
solar masses.[8]
Having a rotation period of 5–6 days, HIP 13044 is a
fast-rotating star for its type. It is possible that this is
because it has swallowed planets during its red-giant
phase.[6]




HIP 13044 has an
apparent magnitude
of 9.94 and cannot be seen with the unaided eye.[8]






Claims of a planetary system


[edit]




In 2010, it was announced that a giant planet in a 16.2-day
orbit had been discovered by the radial velocity
measurements. This would have had implications for planet
formation in metal-poor systems and survival of planets
being engulfed by expanded giant stars.[7]
Subsequent analysis of the data revealed problems with the
detection: for example an erroneous barycentric correction
had been applied (the same error had also led to claims of
planets around
HIP 11952
that were subsequently refuted). After applying the
corrections, there is no evidence for a planet orbiting the
star.[9]
