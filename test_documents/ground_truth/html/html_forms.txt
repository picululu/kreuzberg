Figure in Germanic mythology





"Wodan Heals Balder's Horse" (1905) by
Emil Doepler




Sinthgunt[needs IPA]
is a figure in
Germanic mythology, attested solely in the
Old High German
9th- or 10th-century
Second Merseburg Charm. In the verse charm, Sinthgunt is referred to as the
sister of the personified sun,
Sunna
(whose name is
alliterative
to Sinthgunt),[1]
and the two sisters are cited as both producing incantations
to heal the horse of
Phol, another otherwise unattested figure but possibly the same
as Balder, who is
named elsewhere in the charm. The two are then followed by
Friia and
Uolla, also
alliterative and stated as sisters.




As Sinthgunt is otherwise unattested, her significance is
otherwise unknown, but some scholarly theories exist about
her role in Germanic mythology based on proposed etymologies
and the potential significance of her placement within the
poem.






Etymology

[edit]




The etymology of Sinthgunt is unclear. In the
original manuscript, Sinthgunt is spelled
Sinhtgunt (emphasis added). In the 19th
century,
Sophus Bugge
stuck strictly to this reading, proposing a complex compound
based on Germanic *Sin-naχt-gund, i.e., "the
night-walking one".[2]
As a result of the pairing with Sunna, the personified sun
(corresponding to Old Norse
Sól), this etymology has been interpreted as a reference to
the moon. However,
this reading has yielded problems; the moon in Germanic
mythology is considered masculine, exemplified in the
personification of the moon in
Norse mythology, Máni, a male
figure. According to
Rudolf Simek, the historical record lacks evidence for any cult of
personified celestial bodies among the ancient Germanic
peoples.[3]




Stefan Schaffner rejects this etymology, as does
Heiner Eichner [de], because the first element Sinht- cannot be based
on the presupposed earlier Germanic *sinχt-. Such a
Germanic form would have yielded Old High German
*sīht by regular sound change.[4]
The amended Sinthgunt presupposes a Proto-Germanic
compound *Senþa-gunþjō, the first element meaning
"raid, (military) campaign", the second one "fight". This
interpretation corresponds well to other Old High German
female names such as Sindhilt (from
*Senþa-χilðijō, with its second element also meaning
"fight", cf.
Old Norse
hildr,
Old English
hild).[5]
Simek also mentions the interpretation "heavenly body,
star".[6]





Placement

[edit]




The figures
Fulla (Uolla)
and
Frigg (Friia)
are attested together in later Old Norse sources (though not
as sisters), and theories have been proposed that Fulla may
at one time have been an aspect of Frigg. This notion has
resulted in a theory that a similar situation may have
existed between the figures of Sinthgunt and Sunna/Sól, in
that the two may have been understood as aspects of one
another rather than entirely separate figures.[7]
Similarly,
Wolfgang Beck [de]
analysed her as a subordinate goddess from Sunna's retinue,
a kind of "situation goddess", based on her unique
appearance in the sources.[8]




Friedrich Kauffmann
classified Sinhtgunt as a
valkyrie in
the 19th century, because the elements -gund and
-hild appear frequently in their names.[9]
Stefan Schaffner and Heiner Eichner more recently agreed
with him, based on Günter Müller's paper on the valkyries'
healing powers.[10]




Karl Helm
rejected Kauffmann and grouped Sinhtgunt with the
Idisi
of the
First Merseburg Charm, as a specially defined group of Germanic goddesses.[11]
