Subspecialty of emergency medicine




International emergency medicine is a subspecialty of
emergency medicine
that focuses not only on the global practice of emergency
medicine but also on efforts to promote the growth of
emergency care as a branch of medicine throughout the world.
The term international emergency medicine generally
refers to the transfer of skills and knowledge—including
knowledge of ambulance operations and other aspects of
prehospital care—from developed emergency medical systems (EMSs) to those
systems which are less developed. However, this definition
has been criticized as oxymoronic, given the international
nature of medicine and the number of physicians working
internationally. From this point of view, international
emergency medicine is better described as the training
required for and the reality of practicing the specialty
outside of one's native country.




Emergency medicine has been a recognized medical specialty
in the United States and other developed countries for
nearly forty years, although these countries' EMSs did not
become fully mature until the early 1990s. At that point,
some of its practitioners turned their attention from
developing the specialty at home to developing it abroad,
leading to the birth of international emergency medicine.
They began to support the growth of emergency medicine
worldwide, doing so through conferences, national and
regional emergency medicine organizations, relief and
development organizations, international emergency medicine
fellowships, physician exchanges, information transfer, and
curriculum development.




Most developing countries are taking steps to develop
emergency medicine as a specialty, to develop accreditation
mechanisms, and to promote the development of emergency
medicine training programs. Their interest is a result of
improved healthcare, increasing urbanization, aging
populations, the rising number of traffic fatalities, and
heightened awareness of emergency medicine among their
citizens. In addition, emergency medicine is useful in
dealing with time-sensitive illnesses, as well as improving
public health through vaccinations, interventions, training,
and data collection. Countries that lack mature EMSs are
developing emergency medicine as a specialty so that they
will be able to set up training programs and encourage
medical students to pursue residencies in emergency
medicine.




Some challenges faced in international emergency medicine
include immature or non-existent training programs, a lack
of adequate emergency transport, a shortage of resources to
fund emergency medicine development, and an absence of
research that could inform developing countries how to best
spend the resources they devote to emergency medicine.
Additionally, the standards and methods used in countries
with mature EMSs are not always suited for use in developing
countries due to a lack of
infrastructure, shortage of funds, or local
demographics.
Ambulances, the developed country standard, are costly and not
practical for the road conditions present in many countries;
instead, a variety of modes of transportation are used.
Furthermore, in place of expensive medication and equipment,
developing countries often opt for cheaper if slightly less
effective alternatives. Although it may seem that increasing
availability to emergency medicine must improve health,
there is little empirical evidence to directly support that
claim or to point out which methods are most effective in
improving patient health.
Evidence-based medicine
seeks to address this issue by rigorously studying the
effects of different interventions instead of relying on
logic or tradition.






Background

[edit]





Definition

[edit]




The most commonly accepted definition of international
emergency medicine is that it is "the area of emergency
medicine concerned with the development of emergency
medicine in other countries."[1]
In that definition, "other countries" refers to nations that
do not have a mature emergency care system (exemplified by
board-certified
emergency physicians and academic emergency medicine, among
other things). Included in those nations are some that are
otherwise quite developed but lack a complete emergency
medical system, such as Armenia, China, Israel, Nicaragua,
and the Philippines.[1]
Work in international emergency medicine can be broken down
into two main categories: 1) the promotion of emergency
medicine as a recognized and established specialty in other
countries, and 2) the provision of
humanitarian assistance.[2]




William Burdick, Mark Hauswald, and Kenneth Iserson have
criticized the above definition as oxymoronic, given the
international nature of medicine and the number of
physicians working internationally. From that point of view,
international emergency medicine is not solely about
development of emergency medical systems but is instead
better described as the training required for and the
reality of practicing the specialty outside of one's native
country.[3]





History

[edit]





Emergency medicine

[edit]





Further information:
Emergency_medicine § History




Emergency medicine is a specialty that was first developed
in the United States in the 1960s.[4]
For the United States, the high number of traffic and other
accident fatalities in the 1960s spurred a
white paper
from the
National Academy of Sciences; it exposed the inadequacy of the current emergency
medical system and led to the establishment of modern
emergency medical services.[5]
The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and
Singapore followed shortly thereafter, developing their
respective emergency medicine systems in the 1970s and
1980s.[4]






Beginning of the subspecialty


[edit]





In 1994,
Loma Linda University Medical Center
established the first international emergency medicine
fellowship in the world.[4]




By the early 1990s, the emergency medicine systems (EMSs) in
the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada,
Hong Kong, and Singapore were largely mature, leading some
practitioners to focus on developing the specialty in other
countries.[4]
Thus, international emergency medicine as a subspecialty
began in the 1990s, although some isolated efforts to
achieve some of its goals had taken place in the late
1980s.[4]
There were several reasons for the heightened interest these
practitioners had in developing emergency medicine abroad.
One was the contrast between the EMSs of their countries and
the EMSs of other countries.[4]
Another was the
revolutions of 1989, overthrowing authoritarian regimes, which facilitated
spread of new ideas, such as emergency medicine.[4]




Two international emergency medicine conferences were
launched in the 1980s, the
International Conference on Emergency Medicine
(ICEM) and the
World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine
Conference
(WADEM). ICEM was founded by the International Federation of
Emergency Medicine, while WADEM was started by an
organization of the same name. Additionally, in the 1990s
various national and regional emergency medicine
organizations began supporting the development of the
specialty in other countries, including the
American College of Emergency Physicians, the
European Society for Emergency Medicine, and the
Asian Society of Emergency Medicine.[4]




Furthermore, countries without mature EMSs began taking more
interest in developing them. One reason for this interest
was the overall improvement in healthcare in these
countries. Another was the increasing urbanization taking
place worldwide and the corresponding shift of focus from
infectious diseases
to
trauma
and cardiorespiratory diseases, which are better managed by
emergency medicine than prevention. In addition to these
developments, the aging population in many countries has led
to an increased need for emergency medical services. Also,
American popular culture, particularly television shows,[1]
and "the demonstrated success of emergency medicine" in
countries with mature EMSs both led the public in many
countries to expect better emergency medical care.[4]




International emergency medicine organizations, whether
focused on relief or development, have also contributed to
the growth of the subspecialty. Relief organizations, such
as
Doctors Without Borders
or
AmeriCares, serve countries that do not have mature EMSs when health
catastrophes occur.[1]
These organizations also serve to "enhance [the specialty's]
image in the international public eye".[1]
Some development organizations, such as
Emergency International
or the
International Federation for Emergency Medicine, help establish and develop emergency care systems in
other countries by providing "ongoing educational and
organizational assistance."[1]






Emergency medicine in the developing world


[edit]




Motor vehicle crashes were a major factor that led to the
development of emergency medicine in the United States, the
United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore,
and they are a major factor leading countries to develop
their own emergency medical systems today. Such crashes
represent a leading cause of death for adolescents and young
adults, with the majority of deaths occurring in the
developing world.[6]
In recent decades, while traffic fatalities have declined in
industrialized nations, they have been on the rise in
developing ones. Furthermore, developing nations tend to
have a higher proportion of fatalities per number of
vehicles for various reasons, including lower safety
standards for vehicles.[6]
The lack of available emergency care in many developing
countries only serves to exacerbate this problem. This
higher rate of accident mortality per vehicle exists despite
the fact that there are fewer cars in Asia and Africa than
in the West. Odero et al. argue that this shows a need to
improve emergency medical care.[6]





Motor vehicle accidents such as this one are more likely
to be fatal in developing countries than in developed
ones.




Emergency medical care applies to other acute health
problems as well. Many illnesses with time-sensitive
elements are common in developing countries, including
severe infections,
hypoxia
caused by respiratory infections, dehydration caused by
diarrhoea, intentional and unintentional injuries,
postpartum bleeding, and acute
myocardial infarction. These are potentially life-threatening conditions, yet
effective treatment is often unavailable for much of the
world's population.[7]




For instance, a 2008 study of medical systems in
Zambia published
by the
International Anesthesia Research Society
found that only 50 percent of hospitals had an emergency
medical system that transported patients. Just 24 percent of
ambulances carried oxygen, with only 40 percent carrying
drugs of any kind. Furthermore, only 29 intensive care beds
were available in all of the hospitals surveyed, and these
were only found in major hospitals. This implies that the
majority of
critically ill
patients are receiving care in general hospital wards.[8]




Anderson et al. argue that, aside from acute care, emergency
medicine can also play a significant role in public health.
Vaccinations for many diseases such as
diphtheria, tetanus and
pertussis
can be administered by emergency departments, patients can
be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling
for
substance abuse, and conditions like
hypertension
can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are
excellent locations to train health care providers and to
collect data, because of the high number of patients.
Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing
secondary disease developing from an initial
presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as the
first line of defense in disaster scenarios.[9]






Models of emergency care


[edit]




There are two primary models of emergency medicine: the
Anglo-American model, which relies on "bringing the patient
to the hospital", and the Franco-German model, which
operates through "bringing the hospital to the patient".[1]
Thus, in the Anglo-American model, the patient is rapidly
transported by non-physician providers to definitive care
such as an emergency department in a hospital. Conversely,
the Franco-German approach has a physician, often an
anesthesiologist, come to the patient and provide stabilizing care in the
field. The patient is then
triaged directly
to the appropriate department of a hospital. The
Anglo-American model is seen in nations such as Australia,
Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the
United States, while the Franco-German model is found in
European countries such as Austria, France, Germany, Poland,
Portugal, and Russia. Most developing emergency medical
systems, including those of China, Japan, the Philippines,
South Korea, and Taiwan, have been established along
Anglo-American lines, but little work exists to establish
the advantage of either system.[1]




Jeffrey Arnold and James Holliman have criticized the use of
these descriptors for emergency medical systems as an
oversimplification and a needless source of controversy.[10]
Instead, Arnold and Holliman have proposed that other
groupings be used, such as classifying emergency medical
systems as following a specialty or multidisciplinary model.
Specialty systems would include those with physicians
dedicated to emergency medicine, whereas multidisciplinary
systems would encompass those that rely on physicians from
other disciplines to provide emergency care. Such an
approach would seek to categorize
pre-hospital care
separately from in-hospital systems.[10]
Within Arnold and Holliman's understanding of emergency care
models, there is also an acknowledgement that current
Western models may be inadequate in the context of
developing nations. For instance, a
cost–benefit analysis
found that creating an EMS system in
Kuala Lumpur
that met U.S. standards for
cardiac arrest
response (85 percent of patients receive
defibrillation
within 6 minutes) would cost US$2.5 million and only save
four neurologically intact lives per year. The primary
variable
responsible for that result is the relatively young
demography of Kuala Lumpur, meaning that comparatively few
cardiac-related deaths occur.[11]





An ambulance like this one is too expensive and
impractical for use in many developing countries.




An example of a developing nation establishing its own model
of emergency medicine may be seen in southern Brazil.
Elements of both of the major conventional models have been
incorporated, with the EMS system following French
influences and the ambulances being staffed by physicians,
while an American approach to emergency medical residency
training is also present.[12]






Role in overall health system


[edit]





Developed countries

[edit]




In developed counties, training programs specifically
relating to the international practice of emergency medicine
are now available within many emergency medicine
residencies. The curriculum that should be covered by such
programs has been the subject of much discussion. Patient
care, medical knowledge, practice-based learning,
communication skills, professionalism, and system-based
practice are the basic six competencies required of programs
approved by the
Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, but the application of these goals can take many
forms.[3]
The breadth of skills needed in international emergency
medicine make it unlikely that one standardized program
could fulfill the training needs for every scenario. One
Australian study found that the primary topics covered by
U.S. fellowship programs were emergency medicine systems
development, humanitarian relief,
disaster management, public health,
travel
and
field medicine, program administration, and academic skills.[2]
Its authors argue that attempting to cover all of those
areas may be unrealistic and that a more targeted focus on
acquiring necessary skills might be more productive.[2]




After such training is completed, or even without any EMS
training, working in or visiting other nations is one way
physicians can participate in international emergency
medicine. Some physicians choose to pursue their careers
overseas, while others opt for shorter trips. For example, a
team of U.S. physicians spent seven months helping establish
a new emergency department and emergency residency program
in Hangzhou,
China.[13]
Such exchanges can be mutually beneficial. For instance, 23
to 28 percent of all physicians in Australia, the United
States, the United Kingdom and Canada received their
training at medical schools outside of the country in which
they currently practice.[14]





Developing countries

[edit]





According to Alagappan et al., Africa is the continent
most in need of developing emergency medical systems.[4]




The experience of international emergency medicine in
developing countries is in some ways the opposite of that of
developed ones. As of the 2000s, developing countries are
attempting to establish effective systems of care and
recognized specialty programs with assistance from health
care providers from the developed world. In 2005, there were
only a few countries with advanced emergency medical
systems, and a far greater number (50+) that were in the
process of developing those systems. The process of
development usually begins in academia and patient care,
followed by administrative and economic concerns, and
finally health policy and agendas.[15]




Given the limited resources of many developing nations,
funding vitally effects how emergency medicine fits into the
health system.
Preventive care
is a crucial part of healthcare in developing countries, and
it may be difficult to budget for emergency medicine without
cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem
for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita
health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003.[8]
Regardless of the amount of preventive care available,
health problems requiring immediate attention will still
occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access
to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency
medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive,
particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but
effective treatments administered by
first responders.[16]






Initiatives to expand emergency medicine


[edit]





Curriculum development

[edit]




Hobgood et al. argue that one key component in equipping
nations to develop emergency medical systems is to identify
the aspects of training that are essential for health care
providers. In their view, a standard curriculum is useful
for identifying core issues, even if countries have very
different needs and resources. To address this goal, the
International Federation for Emergency Medicine
developed a model curriculum in 2009.[17]
This initiative seeks to provide a minimum basic standard
that can be tailored to the specific needs of the various
nations implementing training in emergency medicine. It is
targeted towards all medical students in order to produce a
minimum competency in emergency care for all physicians,
regardless of their specialty.[17]





Transferring knowledge

[edit]




Countries with decades of experience in comprehensive
emergency medical systems have expertise that nations that
are just beginning emergency medical programs lack. Thus,
there exists considerable opportunity for the transfer of
knowledge to assist newly founded programs. Such transfers
may be made either from a distance or in person. For
instance, the International Emergency Medicine Fellowship at
the
University of Toronto
sent a three-person team to
Cluj-Napoca, Romania, to
promote the local development of emergency medicine. An
assessment of the present status was performed that
identified targets for improvement in physical plant
organization and patient flow; staffing, staff education,
equipment, medication and supplies; and
infection control
practices. Following these designations, plans regarding
these areas were collaboratively drawn up and then
implemented, partially through international exchange
trips.[18]




Another conduit for the transfer of knowledge is the
International Conference on Emergency Medicine, a conference held every two years for worldwide emergency
physicians by the
International Federation for Emergency Medicine
(IFEM). In 2012, the conference took place in Dublin,
Ireland.[19]
The organization was founded in 1991 by four national
emergency physician organizations: the
American College of Emergency Physicians, the
British Association for Emergency Medicine, the
Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, and the
Australasian College for Emergency Medicine.[20]
The conference rotated between the founding members until
2010, when it was held in Singapore.[21]
Many new members have been accepted since the mid-1990s,
when the IFEM decided to open up membership to other
nations' emergency medicine organizations; the conference
will rotate to them as well.[21]
For instance, in 2014 the conference will be hosted in
Hong Kong
and in 2016 it will be held in
Cape Town,
South Africa.[22]




There are other conferences on international emergency
medicine as well, including the one that the
World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine
(WADEM) has held every two years since 1987. However, WADEM
focuses more on
disaster medicine
than emergency medicine system development, and many of its
member physicians are not specialists in emergency medicine.
Additionally, the
European Society for Emergency Medicine
(EuSEM) has hosted an annual conference since 1998. EuSEM
also publishes
The European Journal of Emergency Medicine, develops recommendations for emergency medicine standards
for European countries, and supports a disaster medicine
training center and degree program in
San Marino. The Asian Society for Emergency Medicine (Asian Society),
which was founded in 1998, holds its own biennial
conference. In addition to that, the Asian Society, like the
EuSEM, develops curriculum recommendations for Asian
countries.[4]






Developing emergency medicine as a specialty


[edit]




One way to advance emergency medical care is to obtain the
recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty in
countries that currently lack it. Without such recognition,
it is difficult to set up training programs or recruit
potential students, as they face the uncertainty of training
to obtain a credential that may end up being useless to
them. Recognition increases the visibility and prestige of
the profession and promotes other efforts to advance its
development.
Botswana may
serve as a case study. Its recent recognition of emergency
medicine as a specialty has been closely accompanied by the
creation of the
Botswana Society for Emergency Care, the establishment of a Resuscitation Training Centre and
a Trauma Research Centre at the
University of Botswana, and the formation of a committee to design a national
policy for pre-hospital care.[23]




An alternate route for developing emergency medicine is to
provide additional training for other specialists to equip
them to practice in emergency medicine. This has the benefit
of being more rapid to implement, as physicians already
trained in other areas can add the necessary emergency
skills to their repertoire. However, after the initial
expansion it is difficult for emergency medicine to progress
further in nations that adopt this strategy, as the
retrained practitioners identify more with their original
specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for
further innovations in emergency medicine.[10]





Challenges

[edit]





Training

[edit]




Educational opportunities in emergency medicine are not
available in many countries, and even when present, they are
often in their infancy. Botswana opened its first medical
school in 2009, with a program in emergency medicine
following in 2011.[23]
The program aims to train four to six physicians in
emergency medicine each year. Limitations on in-country
training mean that the program includes six months of
training at an international site. The organization of the
program is modeled on South Africa's program due to the
similarities in resource constraints and
disease burdens
and the eagerness of
College of Emergency Medicine of South Africa
and
Emergency Medicine Society of South Africa
to support the expansion of emergency medicine. Two years of
clinical practice are required before entering the residency
program, as in the South African and Australian
approaches.[23]




To deal with this shortage of educational opportunities,
Scott Weiner et al. suggest that countries with developed
emergency medical systems should focus on training the
trainers. This, he believes, is a sustainable approach to
promote the development of emergency medicine worldwide. It
works by sending developed country health care workers to
equip a small group of trainees with the necessary skills to
then go on and teach the concepts to others. As such, it may
be able to leverage the insights of developed emergency
medical systems while remaining sustainable, as the newly
trained trainers continue to spread the knowledge. The
Tuscan Emergency Medicine Initiative is an example, with
physicians from other specialties currently working in
emergency departments being taught how to teach a new group
of emergency medical specialists.[24]





Emergency transport

[edit]




The limitations on resources available in developing
countries are particularly evident in the area of emergency
transport.
Ambulances,
the developed country standard, are costly and not practical
for the road conditions present in many countries. Indeed,
there may be no roads at all. One study found that modes of
transport as diverse as motorboats, canoes, bicycles with
trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers,
reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts were used for emergency
transport.[7]




In more advanced developing countries, establishing
ambulance transport systems is more feasible, but still
requires considerable expertise and planning. Prior to 2004,
Pakistan did
not have an organized emergency medical system.[25]
In that year,
Rescue 1122
was launched as a professional pre-hospital emergency
service, and it has managed to achieve an average response
time of 7 minutes, comparable to that of developed nations.
Some of the critical factors in its success included local
manufacture of vehicles, training instructors to certify
emergency medical technicians, adopting training materials to the local context, and
branching out to include fire and rescue service response
under a united command structure.[25]





Resources

[edit]

















Broselow tape











Green bananas











Misoprostol pills









Alternative treatments for resource-constrained
environments










The vital nature of coping with the lack of resources
available in international emergency medicine may be seen in
the proportion of scientific articles that grapple with the
topic. Of the top 27 articles identified by a review of the
international emergency medicine literature from 2010, 14
were classified as dealing with the practice of emergency
medicine in resource-constrained environments.[26]
A new dimension of thought is that of the isolated subject
of technology for trauma care as published in the World
Journal of Surgery by
Mihir Shah
et al.[27]
Topics covered included the use of the
Broselow tape
as the best estimate for children's weight, green bananas as
an effective treatment for diarrhea, and
misoprostol
as a potential alternative for postpartum hemorrhage when
oxytocin is
not available.[26]





Lack of research

[edit]




Despite the thought that increasing availability to
emergency medicine will improve patient outcomes, little
empirical evidence exists to directly support that claim,
even in developed countries. Between 1985 and 1998 only 54
randomized controlled trials
related to emergency medical services were published,
implying that much of the current standard of care rests
upon meager support.[10]
A similar lack of direct proof exists for the effectiveness
of international assistance in promoting emergency medicine
in other countries. Although it may seem that such efforts
must improve health, the failure to quantify international
emergency medicine's impact renders it more difficult to
identify the best practices and target areas in which the
most benefit may be achieved.[1]




A development in recent years that seeks to address these
issues has been termed
evidence-based medicine. As its name suggests, this approach strives to rigorously
study the effects of different interventions instead of
relying on logic or tradition.[1]
Jeffrey Arnold argues that its application worldwide could
lead to the boon of sharing best practices between emergency
medicine practitioners in various countries, thus advancing
the current standard of emergency care.[1]
