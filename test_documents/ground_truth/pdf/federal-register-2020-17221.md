**RIN 2120-AA64**

### Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

**AGENCY:** Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

**ACTION:** Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

**SUMMARY:** The FAA proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 by superseding an Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018–23–51, which applies to all The Boeing Company Model 737–8 and 737–9 (737 MAX) airplanes. Since AD 2018–23–51 was issued, the agency has determined that final action is necessary to address the unsafe condition on these products. This proposed AD would also allow operation of airplanes with certain inoperative systems only if certain provisions are incorporated in the operator's existing FAA-approved minimum equipment list (MEL). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

**DATES:** The FAA must receive comments on this proposed AD by September 21, 2020.

**ADDRESSES:** You may send comments, using the procedures found in 14 CFR 11.43 and 11.45, by any of the following methods:

- Federal eRulemaking Portal: Go to https://www.regulations.gov. Follow the instructions for submitting comments.

## Background

On October 29, 2018, a Boeing Model 737–8 airplane operated by Lion Air (Lion Air Flight 610) was involved in an accident after takeoff from Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Jakarta, Indonesia, resulting in 189 fatalities. Investigation of the accident has been completed by the Indonesian authorities (Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNST) with assistance from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the FAA of the United States, the manufacturer, and the operator. Reports from the accident investigation indicate that the airplane's flight control system generated repeated airplane nose-down horizontal stabilizer trim commands contributing to the accident.

Following the Lion Air Flight 610 accident on October 29, 2018, data from the airplane, which is contained in the Indonesian accident report, which may be found on the internet at https://knkt.basarnas.go.id/knkt-basarnas/baru/2018%20-%20 LOP%20Final%20Report.pdf, indicated a significant high angle of attack (AOA) sensor input into the flight control system while the flaps are retracted can cause repeated airplane nose-down trim of the horizontal stabilizer.

These effects include stall warning activation, airspeed disagree alert, and uncommanded horizontal stabilizer trim commands contributing to the accident.

Following the Lion Air Flight 610 accident on October 29, 2018, data from the airplane, which is contained in the Indonesian accident report, which may be found on the internet at https://knkt.basarnas.go.id/knkt-basarnas/baru/2018%20-%20 LOP%20Final%20Report.pdf, indicated a significant high angle of attack (AOA) sensor input into the flight control system while the flaps are retracted can cause repeated airplane nose-down trim of the horizontal stabilizer. These effects include stall warning activation, airspeed disagree alert, and uncommanded horizontal stabilizer trim commands contributing to the accident.

The data from the flight data recorder, as summarized in reports 7 of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accident, indicated that a single erroneously high AOA sensor input received by the flight control system, the maintenance augmentation system (MCAS) can command airplane nose-down trim of the horizontal stabilizer. This unsafe condition, if not addressed, could cause the flightcrew to have difficulty controlling the airplane, and lead to excessive airplane nose-down attitude, significant altitude loss, and impact with terrain.

To address this unsafe condition, the FAA proposes to require four design changes to the 737 MAX type design, to address the various aspects of the unsafe condition. First, the flight control law has been changed to instead use pitch inputs from two AOA sensors for MCAS activations, so that there would be an undesired MCAS activation as a result of input from a single failed sensor. The second design change is intended to ensure that after any foreseeable failure of the stabilizer system, safe flight is not dependent on the timeliness of the flightcrew performing a non-normal procedure. To ensure that after any foreseeable failure of the stabilizer system, safe flight is not dependent on the timeliness of the flightcrew performing a non-normal procedure, the FAA proposes multiple changes. First, as previously discussed, the flight control laws would be changed to instead use pitch inputs from two AOA sensors for MCAS activations, so that there would be an undesired MCAS activation as a result of input from a single failed sensor. The updated FCC software would compare the inputs from the two sensors to detect a failed AOA sensor. If the difference between the AOA sensor inputs is above a calculated threshold, the FCC would limit the magnitude of any MCAS activation so that the flightcrew could maintain pitch control without needing to perform an uncommanded horizontal stabilizer trim.

## Proposed Design Changes

The FAA proposes mandating the following changes to the 737 MAX type design, to address the various aspects of the unsafe condition disclosed. First, the flight control law would be changed to instead use pitch inputs from two AOA sensors for MCAS activations, so that there would be an undesired MCAS activation as a result of input from a single failed sensor. The updated FCC software would compare the inputs from the two sensors to detect a failed AOA sensor.

The updated FCC software would implement an AOA DISAGREE alert on all 737 MAX airplanes. Some 737 MAX airplanes were delivered without this alert, by error. While the lack of an AOA DISAGREE alert is not an unsafe condition itself, the FAA is proposing to require installation of updated FCC software with revised flight control laws.

### Proposed Maintenance-Related Actions

To ensure that each airplane's two AOA sensors are functioning properly upon return to service, the FAA proposes to mandate that operators perform an AOA sensor system test on each airplane prior to return to service. This test uses a fixture to position the AOA vane and verify that the reading provided by each AOA sensor is accurate.

The FAA allows operators to utilize an MEL for time-limited operation with certain equipment inoperative, after which the system must be fully restored.

## Emergency Order of Prohibition

Since this NPRM proposes to supersede AD 2018–23–51, the procedural information required by that AD would be outdated when the rule is effective and therefore would be removed.

As part of the FAA's review of these design changes proposed in this NPRM, the agency reviewed the entirety of the 737 MAX horizontal stabilizer control system. This review revealed that the physical separation of the horizontal stabilizer trim and the horizontal stabilizer trim control wiring installations must have enough physical separation so that a single event cannot create a hazard. Since design changes must comply with FAA regulations, the FAA proposes to require changes to the wiring installation to meet the required physical separation between the horizontal stabilizer trim arm wiring and the horizontal stabilizer trim control wiring. The FAA proposes this to prevent erroneous wiring installation or inspection program without obtaining approval of an AMOC, provided the RC step and any figures identified in an RC step must be complied with.

## Authority for This Rulemaking

Title 49 of the United States Code specifies that the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, Section 106, describes the scope of the Agency's authority.

The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority delegated to me by the Administrator.

---

## Proposed AD Requirements

This proposed AD would require the following actions:

- Installing new FCC OPS software and doing a software installation verification.
- Revising the existing AFM to incorporate new and revised information and procedures, and to remove information from the applicable based on the changes specified in this proposed AD.
- Requiring, for operators who wish to allow dispatch of an airplane with certain inoperative systems, incorporation of certain provisions into the operator's existing FAA-approved MEL.

---

## Related Service Information Under 1 CFR Part 51

The FAA reviewed the following service information:

- Boeing Special Attention Service Bulletin 737–27–1318, Revision 1, dated June 12, 2020, describes procedures for installation of AOA sensor system software and related information.
- Boeing Special Attention Service Bulletin 737–27–1318, Revision 1, dated June 12, 2020, describes procedures for changing of the horizontal stabilizer trim wire routing installations.

## Costs of Compliance

The FAA estimates that this proposed AD affects 73 aircraft in U.S. registry. The agency estimates the following costs to comply with this proposed AD:

| Action | Labor cost | Parts cost | Cost per product | Cost on U.S. operators |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| FCC OPS installation and verification | 1 work-hour × $85 per hour = $85 | $0 | $85 | $6,205 |
| AFM revisions | 1 work-hour × $85 per hour = $85 | $0 | $85 | $6,205 |
| MDS installation and verification, INOP marker removal | 1 work-hour × $85 per hour = $85 | $0 | $85 | $6,205 |
| Stabilizer wiring change | Up to 79 work-hours × $85 per hour = Up to $6,715 | Up to $3,790 | Up to $10,505 | Up to $766,865 |
| AOA sensor system test | 40 work-hours × $85 per hour = $3,400 | $0 | $3,400 | $248,200 |

---

## Regulatory Findings

The FAA has determined that this proposed AD would not have a federalism implication under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and does not impose requirements for the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.

---

## Costs of Compliance (Continued)

The FAA has received no definitive data with which it could accurately provide cost estimates for the operational readiness flight specified in this proposed AD.

Operators that have a MEL and choose to dispatch an airplane with certain inoperative systems, incorporation of certain provisions into the operator's existing FAA-approved MEL.

This proposed AD would require the following actions:

- Installing new FCC OPS software and doing a software installation verification.
