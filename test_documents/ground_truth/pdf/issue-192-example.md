## Abstract

**Purpose** – This research aims to investigate the efficacy of family involvement in shift work training targeting both physiological and social coping strategies.

**Design/methodology/approach** – The study utilized repeated surveys of work-family conflict (WFC) and family-work conflict (FWC) in a naturally occurring field experiment. Three small process manufacturing sites introduced training for shift workers, with or without family involvement, and with or without training materials.

**Findings** – The inclusion of social coping strategies combined with family involvement significantly reduced work-family conflict. Open response categories on the survey suggest that these reductions were due to the facilitation of a joint problem-solving approach by family members. In contrast, information-only training on physiological sleep does not appear to increase family conflicts.

**Research limitations/implications** – As a field study, this paper cannot control for the particular family situations. It should also be noted that the participants were all male, and results may have differed for female shift workers given differing family and work expectations.

**Practical implications** – For employees and OEM officers, this research suggests that broader spectrum training may assist shift workers in managing the requirements and impact of unsociable hours of work. For the shift worker, the research reinforces the importance of family support and family involvement in moderating shift work's potentially negative effects.

**Originality/value** – This is the first study to assess the impact of family involvement in training and development-based interventions. This paper provides a unique perspective on shift work interventions by documenting both content and process effects for shift work support.

In discussing work-life balance, the focus is often on the amount of time spent at work, and the inflexibility of work time and place to accommodate family and other requirements. In both research and the popular literature, however, the focus of this balancing act is in a traditional 9-5 view of employment that spills over – in hours and energy – to a fairly traditional view of non-work life. The issue of balance may become more difficult, however, when the "work" in work-life balance is a series of rotating or shifts.
