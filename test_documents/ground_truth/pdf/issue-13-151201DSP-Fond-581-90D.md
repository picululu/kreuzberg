## Description of the incident, including the suspected cause of death, injury or egregious abuse or neglect:

On December 1, 2015, the agency received a report regarding a 3-year-old child brought to the hospital with head injuries. Medical professionals who examined the child suspected head trauma due to the child's presenting symptoms, so the child was transported to another hospital. Law enforcement was contacted and initiated a criminal investigation regarding the child's suspicious injuries. Medical personnel determined that the child's injuries were caused by accidental means. No criminal charges have been filed in this case and the case has been closed by law enforcement.

## Findings by agency, including maltreatment determination and material circumstances leading to incident:

The agency collaborated with law enforcement and medical personnel to complete the assessment. The Initial Assessment completed by the agency found insufficient evidence to substantiate physical abuse of the child by the mother. The Medical Examiner's Office completed report determined that the child's head trauma was caused by accidental means. The agency determined the child and his mother's boyfriend's child to be safe in the family home. The family was referred to community services and the agency closed the case upon completion of the Initial Assessment.
