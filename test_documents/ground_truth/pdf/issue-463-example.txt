THE GRASSHOPPER

A grasshopper spent the summer hopping about in the sun and singing to his heart's content.

One day, an ant went hurrying by, looking very hot and weary.

"Why are you working on such a lovely day?"

Said the grasshopper.

I am collecting food for the winter. I recommend you do the same, said the ant. And she went, helping the other ants carry food to their store. The grasshopper continued hopping and singing. When winter came, the ground was covered with snow. The grasshopper had no food and was hungry. So he went to the ants and asked for food.

What did you do all summer when we were working to collect our food? said one of the ants. I was busy hopping and singing, said the grasshopper. Well, said the ant, if you hop and sing all summer and don't work, then you must starve in the winter.

And she went, helping the other ants carry food to their store. The grasshopper continued hopping and singing. When winter came, the ground was covered with snow. The grasshopper had no food and was hungry. So he went to the ants and asked for food.

In another moment.

Down went Alice after it.

Never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down,

So suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
