Welcome to the meeting of the Cupertino Union School District Board of Education. If you would like to address the Board during Public Comments on any agenda item or any item not on the agenda, please fill out a comment card available in the hallway and give it to the Administrative Assistant. You will be called on to comment during this time and comments will be limited to three (3) minutes. To ensure that all speakers are provided an equal opportunity to address the Board during Public Comments, individual speakers may not "yield" their allotted time to address the Board to other speakers. In addition, the Board may, in accordance with the Brown Act (Section 54954.2 of the Government Code), limit the total amount of time allocated for comment on a particular issue. The Board may choose to respond to agenda item comments or reserve their responses for discussion and action when the agenda item appears during the course of the meeting. It should be noted that the Board discourages complaints against individual officers or employees of the District during open session.

Individuals who require special accommodation should contact the Superintendent's Office at (408) 252-3000, ext. 61200 at least two business days before the meeting date.
