The Voice of God Again Is Heard

18

Majestically ♩ = 69–80

1. The voice of God again is heard. The silence has been broken.
2. O messengers of truth, go forth, Proclaim the gospel story,

The curse of darkness is withdrawn. The Lord from heav'n has spoken.
Go forth the nations to prepare To greet the King of glory.

Rejoice, ye living and ye dead! Rejoice, for your salvation
We shout hosanna, shout again, Till all creation blend—ing

Begins a new this happy morn Of final dispensation.
Shall join in one great, grand amen Of anthems never—ending.

Text and music: Evan Stephens, 1854–1930
Joseph Smith—History 1:17
Doctrine and Covenants 128:19, 22–23
