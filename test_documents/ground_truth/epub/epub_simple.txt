Reflowable EPUB 3 Conformance Test Document: 0100

Status of this Document

This publication is currently considered [UNDER
DEVELOPMENT] by the IDPF.

This publication is part of version X.X
of the EPUB 3.0 Compliance Test Suite released on
TBD.

Before using this publication to evaluate reading systems, testers
are strongly encouraged to verify that they have the latest release by
checking the current release version and date of the test suite at TBD

This publication is one of several that currently comprise the EPUB 3
conformance test suite for reflowable content. The complete test suite
includes all of the following publications:

.

About this Document

This document focuses on human-evaluated binary (pass/fail) tests in
a reflowable context. Tests for fixed-layout content and other
individual tests that require a dedicated epub file are available in
additional sibling documents; refer to the test
suite wiki
(https://github.com/mgylling/epub-testsuite/wiki/Overview)
for additional information.

Conventions

The following conventions are used throughout the document:

1. Locating a test

Tests for required Reading System functionality are preceded
by the label: [REQUIRED]

Tests for optional Reading System functionality are preceded
by the label: [OPTIONAL]

2. Performing the test

Each test includes a description of its purpose followed by the actual
test statement, which can always be evaluated to true or
false. These statements typically have the form: "If [some
condition], the test passes".

3. Scoring in the results form

@@@TODO provide info on where to get the results form

MathML

[REQUIRED] mathml-010 Rendering

Tests whether MathML equation rendering is supported.

$$\int_{- \infty}^{\infty}e^{- x^{2}}\, dx =
\sqrt{\pi}$$ $$\sum\limits_{n =
1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2}} = \frac{\pi^{2}}{6}$$ $$x = \frac{- b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} -
4ac}}{2a}$$

If the preceding equations are not presented as linear text (e.g.,
x=-b±b2-4ac2a), the test passes.

[OPTIONAL] mathml-020 CSS Styling of the math
element

Tests whether basic CSS styling of MathML is supported on the
math element.

2x+y − z

The test passes if the equation has a yellow background and a dashed
border.

If the reading system does not have a viewport, or does not support
CSS styles, this test should be marked Not Supported.

[OPTIONAL] mathml-021 CSS Styling of the mo
element

Tests whether basic CSS styling of MathML is supported on the
mo element.

2x+y − z

The test passes if the operators are enlarged relative to the other
symbols and numbers.

If the reading system does not have a viewport, or does not support
CSS styles, this test should be marked Not Supported.

[OPTIONAL] mathml-022 CSS Styling of the mi
element

Tests whether basic CSS styling of MathML is supported on the
mi element.

2x+y − z

The test passes if the identifiers are bolded and blue.

If the reading system does not have a viewport, or does not support
CSS styles, this test should be marked Not Supported.

[OPTIONAL] mathml-023 CSS Styling of the mn
element

Tests whether basic CSS styling of MathML is supported on the
mn element.

2x+y − z

The test passes if the number 2 is italicized and blue.

If the reading system does not have a viewport, or does not support
CSS styles, this test should be marked Not Supported.

[REQUIRED] mathml-024Horizontal stretch, mover,
munder, and mspace elements

Tests whether horizontal stretch, mover,
munder, mspace elements are supported.

$$c = \overset{\text{complex
number}}{\overbrace{\underset{\text{real}}{\underbrace{\mspace{20mu}
a\mspace{20mu}}} + \underset{\text{imaginary}}{\underbrace{\quad
b{\mathbb{i}}\quad}}}}$$

The test passes if the rendering looks like .

[REQUIRED] mathml-025Testing mtable with
colspan and rowspan attributes, Hebrew and
Script fonts

Tests whether mtable with colspan and
mspace attributes (column and row spanning) are supported;
uses Hebrew and Script alphabets.

$$\begin{matrix}
& {\operatorname{cov}(\mathcal{L})} & \longrightarrow &
{\operatorname{non}(\mathcal{K})} & \longrightarrow &
{\operatorname{cof}(\mathcal{K})} & \longrightarrow &
{\operatorname{cof}(\mathcal{L})} & \longrightarrow &
2^{\aleph_{0}} \\
& \uparrow & & \uparrow & & \uparrow & &
\uparrow & & \\
& {\mathfrak{b}} & \longrightarrow & {\mathfrak{d}} &
& & & & & \\
& \uparrow & & \uparrow & & & & & &
\\
\aleph_{1} & \longrightarrow & {\operatorname{add}(\mathcal{L})}
& \longrightarrow & {\operatorname{add}(\mathcal{K})} &
\longrightarrow & {\operatorname{cov}(\mathcal{K})} &
\longrightarrow & {\operatorname{non}(\mathcal{L})} &
\end{matrix}$$

The test passes if the rendering looks like Cichoń's
Diagram: .

[REQUIRED] mathml-026BiDi, RTL and Arabic alphabets

Tests whether right-to-left and Arabic alphabets are supported.

$${د(س)} = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
{\sum\limits_{ٮ = 1}^{ص}س^{ٮ}} & {\text{إذاكان}س > 0} \\
{\int_{1}^{ص}{س^{ٮ}ءس}} & {\text{إذاكان}س \in م} \\
{{طا}\pi} & {\text{غيرذلك}\left( \text{مع}\pi \simeq 3,141 \right)}
\end{matrix} \right.$$

The test passes if the rendering looks like the following image:

[REQUIRED] mathml-027Elementary math: long division
notation

Tests whether mlongdiv elements (from elementary math)
are supported.

3
435.3 1306 12 10 9 16 15 1.0 9 1

The test passes if the rendering looks like the following image:
.

epub:switch

[REQUIRED] switch-010 Support

Tests whether the epub:switch
element is supported.

PASS

If only the word "PASS" is rendered before this paragraph, the test
passes. If both "PASS" and "FAIL" are rendered, or neither "PASS" nor
"FAIL" is rendered, the test fails.

[OPTIONAL] switch-020 MathML Embedding

Tests whether the MathML namespace is recognized when used in an epub:case
element.

2x+y − z

If a MathML equation is rendered before this paragraph, the test
passes.

If test switch-010 did not pass, this test should be
marked Not Supported.
